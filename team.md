Mathias specializes in the design and development of decision systems and forecasting models.
He has been developing .NET applications for the past 8 years, for a variety of industries
ranging from biotech to retail and global health.

He is a Microsoft MVP for F#, and was previously MVP for VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office).
He leads the San Francisco chapter of the [Bay.NET user group](http://www.baynetug.org/),
and the [San Francisco F# user group](http://www.sfsharp.org/) and
speaks regularly at user group meetings around the world.
He has a MS in Operations Research from Stanford, an MS in Economics
from the University of Paris 10, and a MBA from ESSEC.

When not in front of his computer, he can often be found at the gym practicing Muay Thai.
Or at the closest Coffee House, having his umpteenth Espresso of the day.

> “I am very passionate about F#, good design and development practices, with a specific interest
  in test-driven development, and enjoy looking at code, arguing about it, and finding ways to make it better.”

Tomas is a computer scientist, open-source developer and a lecturer at <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a>.
He has been using F# since the early Microsoft Research versions many years ago for both research, open-source and commercial
work. He has a PhD from the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> and worked in 
Microsoft Research and the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> in London.

He is the author of the popular F#-centric book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-functional-programming">Real World Functional Programming</a>,
and has written numerous articles and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/33518/tomas-petricek">StackOverflow answers</a>.
He has been a Microsoft C# MVP since 2004.
He is also a frequent speaker at F# and .NET events, and a founding member of the <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F# Foundation</a>.

He is the creator of the [F# Formatting](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) library and has made major contributions
to libraries such as [F# Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) and [Deedle](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/).
In his recent work, he has been building a simple data exploration programming environment
<a href="https://thegamma.net/">The Gamma</a>.

> “I enjoy combining theory and practice. On the theory side, my PhD is on type systems,
  but I also enjoy the practical side, writing open-source software, doing training and consulting, 
  and supporting the community.”

Scott has over 20 years experience in development, design and architecture,
covering all aspects of business software. He has a MA in math from Cambridge University.

He is the creator of one of the leading F# web sites, <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">fsharpforfunandprofit.com</a>,
and the author of the forthcoming book <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandingfunctionalprogramming">Understanding Functional Programming</a>.

In addition to functional programming, he has had a lot of experience with object-oriented
design principles, having used and written about Smalltalk for many years.

> “I feel that having experience in both OO and FP helps me to bridge the gap between the
  (sometimes hostile) camps effectively and productively. Despite my love of F#, I am pragmatic and technology agnostic.
  I prefer to use a mixture of top-down and bottom-up design, getting the best of both, and using iterative development and
  early deployment to mitigate risk.”
