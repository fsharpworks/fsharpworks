The **fsharpWorks** team has many years of experience solving real-world problems with F# in a
wide range of areas including finance, business application development, machine learning and other.

That said, we are not experts in everything. That is why we have a trusted network of partners who
are always willing to complement our skills or join a large project that requires a bigger team.
