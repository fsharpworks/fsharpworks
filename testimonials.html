            The <b>fsharpWorks</b> team has been providing F# trainings since 2011. This means that
            we don't just have in-depth knowledge of F#, but we also know how to teach it. We know
            where people often struggle and how to explain functional-first programming in
            an easy to understand way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attendees of our trainings and workshops include many F# community leaders, including
            Microsoft MVPs awarded for F# later. A number of our attendees also contributed
            an <a href="http://fsharp.org/testimonials/">testimonial at fsharp.org</a> about their
            succesfull use of F#.

                “Having struggled a couple of times to get up to speed with F# on my own, I attended a fsharpworks 2-day F# course run by Phil and Tomas. It was exactly what I needed – practical, real-world examples and hands-on labs designed to build confidence in my ability to solve problems in idiomatic F# along with expert guidance that kept my interest throughout. I would highly recommend this course for software developers that want to learn how to solve problems using functional programming techniques and quickly get up to speed with F#.”
