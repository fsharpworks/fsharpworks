                <p>
                    F# is an open-source, cross-platform, functional first programming language. F# has seen an <a href="http://www.eweek.com/developer/microsofts-f-language-number-12-with-a-bullet.html">explosive growth in 2013</a>, and is not slowing down. F# makes it easy to model complex problems simply. It offers great benefits in terms of reliability and safety. Its lightweight syntax make it a fantastic language for scripting, rapid prototyping, and interactive data exploration, with all the performance benefits of a statically typed language. And it integrates smoothly with existing .NET code bases. And... it makes coding fun again! So if you want to take your development skills to the next level, come and join us for a fast track to F#!
