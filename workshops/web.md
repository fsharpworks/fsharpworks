One of the myths about F# and functional programming is that it is only good for complex mathematics. This could not be further from truth. A web server is essentially a function from a request to a response and so functional programming is a perfect fit for it.

In this one-day workshop, you'll learn all you need to get started with building web applications in F# using the Suave.io server. We'll start with an walkthrough that introduces the basic F# concepts and constructs and uses them to build a simple interactive web site. By the end of the workshop, you'll write a application that accesses multiple external data sources asynchronously, uses agent-based programming model and WebSockets to send data to the client and can be easily deployed to Azure or Heroku.


### Takeaways

The course requires no prior functional programming knowledge, but if you have done some F# before, we
have many fun bonus problems for you. You will learn:


* How to model domain using functional types and write functions that work with it
* How to use type providers to access JSON-based REST services, CSV and XML data
* How to write web applications using Suave &amp; deploy them to Heroku and Azure
* Writing reactive web applications using web sockets, asynchronous workflows and agent-based concurrency with MailboxProcessor

### Course structure and requirements


A brief theoretical introduction to every concept will be followed by numerous practical demos and exercises. 
At the end of the workshop, you'll leave with a complete real-world F# application. 

The course doesn't require prior experience with F# or functional programming. 
You will need a laptop with F# installed.

## Course outline

In the course, you get to work on one or more sample projects. After explaining
the basic Suave concepts, we'll give you a basic template with a plenty of 
fun exercises that gradually introduce the library and the F# language. Here
is a list of sample projects that we did in the past.

### Pollz: Simple polling web site

Create a simple polling site that reads poll information from JSON data,
lets the users vote in different polls, saves the results and even
visualizes results of polls using charts.</p>

As a bonus problem, you can also monitor the poll status using WebSockets
and refresh the results whenever another user votes.</p>

### WhatsF#app: The $900 million chat

In this demo, you get to create a simple chatting site (be it WhatsApp or Slack).
Users can enter one or more chatrooms, send messages to the rooms and see what
is happening. On the backend, agent-based architecture using F# `MailboxProcessor`
is used to handle requests in a scaleable way.</p>

### MoonBot: Cortana's stupid little brother

Write a question. Get an answer. Or maybe not, because MoonBot is not as clever.
But if you program it, it will be! The idea is to write a bot that can find
interesting information such as news, weather forecasts, stock prices or even
Urban Dictionary definitions. This is a great way to learn how to call services                  
and access a variety of data sources.
