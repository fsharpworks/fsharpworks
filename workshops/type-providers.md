Modern applications need to access data from a variety of external data sources, including 
XML, SQL, and JSON-based services. In this course, we look at F# type providers. With type
providers, you can easily explore and access a wide range of data sources directly from your code editor. 
We start by learning about type providers using the F# interactive and then we demonstrate how you can 
integrate data access code written in F# as part of a larger C# ASP.NET project. 

### Learn how to

* Use type providers to call REST-based services
* Effectively work with XML, JSON and CSV data
* Learn how to integrate F# with ASP.NET and C# projects
* Access data in SQL databases and work with Azure 
* Use F# asynchronous workflows and agents to write scalable concurrent code

### Course prerequisites


The course doesn't require prior experience with F# or functional programming. To benefit from the course, you should have working knowledge of some object-oriented language. Some knowledge of ASP.NET will be beneficial.


### Course labs & exercises

A brief theoretical introduction to every concept will be followed by numerous practical demos and exercises. At the end of the first day, you&#39;ll leave with a complete real-world F# application. In the second day, we&#39;ll solve a number of complex problems in concurrent and data-oriented programming.
