Machine Learning and Functional Programming are both very hot topics these days; they are also both rather intimidating for the beginner. In this workshop, we’ll take a 100% hands-on approach, and learn practical ideas from Machine Learning, by tackling real-world problems and implementing solutions in F#, in a functional style.

In the process, you will see that once you get beyond the jargon, F# and Machine Learning are actually not all that complicated – and fit beautifully together. So if you are curious about what Machine Learning is about, and want to sharpen your developer skills, come with your laptop and… let’s hack together!

## Course outline

In this course, you will be working on real-world datasets, applying a variety of machine learning techniques, using a functional programming approach. In the process, you will gradually learn simple but fundamental and widely applicable machine learning ideas, and develop a sense for what it means to "do machine learning", and where there are similarities and differences with writing "normal" code.

### Day 1

The Digit Recognizer: write and validate a program that recognizes hand-written digits. From scratch.

- Setting up a machine learning experiment
- Validating the quality of a model
- The K-Nearest-Neighbors classifier
- Distance 
- Preparing data using functional pipelines

Recognizing Languages: automatically detecting what language a piece of text is written in.

- Transforming raw data (text) into usable features
- Learning with gradient descent
- The Perceptron (aka Logistic Regression), the building block of neural networks
- Using Discriminated Unions (Algebraic Data Types) to model data structures

Working with large datasets

- Reducing the dimension of data with PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Clustering with K-Means
- Working with big data using mbrace

### Day 2

Predicting Wine Quality: evaluate how good a wine is, based on its chemical characteristics.

- Using Decision and Regression Trees
- Combining weak prediction models into better ones with Random Forests
- The problem of over-fitting
- Using types to model machine learning experiments
- Accessing data using F# type providers
- Using an existing machine learning library

Forecasting Bicycle Usage: discover usage patterns in historical data to explain usage of a bicycle sharing service.

- Making predictions with Linear Regression
- Handling different types of input: continuous/numeric and discrete/categorical features
- Feature engineering: creating and combining data into informative features
