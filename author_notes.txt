Use relative paths for links and images so that sit can be tested locally.

html tags with markdown="1" are used for bootstrap rows (see index.md for lots of examples)
When mixing markdown and HTML, html tags MUST start on left margin


YAML header for each page
* title - page title
* description - page title
* nav - if set to "Home" the home button on nav bar is active. Ditto for "Materials", "Team", etc. See navbar.inc in /_includes/ 
* layout - Which template for the page:
     "page" - has a single banner image
     "homepage" - has a carousel
     The page templates are stored in /_layouts/
* banner1 - html for banner line 1.      
* banner2 - html for banner line 2. Inline HTML is OK but no double quotes (use singles)
* bannerImage - CSS id of image for banner ("page" template only) - eg "img1" "img2"
