# Workshops and training sessions

No matter what your background is, our workshops and trainings will help you get started with F#.
We expect that you have some programming background, but no prior experience with F# or the
theme of the workshop is needed.
If you would like to arrange a private, personalized workshop, please contact us directly.
We'll be happy to design a workshop or training to fit exactly your needs!

## [Fast Track to F#](workshops/fast-track.html)

This two day Fast Track to F# course is what you need to start using F# in practice and to get
the most out of functional and concurrent programming concepts.

The course is designed by F# experts Tomas Petricek and Phil Trelford and
builds on their real-world experience with F#. You'll learn how to use F# in production for
domain modelling, data processing, concurrency and more!

## Machine Learning with F# ##

Machine learning is the art of writing program that become better at performing tasks using data.
In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to use the power of F# by building simple but effective
machine learning predictive models and solving real-world problems.

You will learn
fundamental concepts and methods of machine learning that are broadly applicable by software engineers,
and gain a solid foundation to start writing clean and effective F# code.

## [Functional web development](workshops/web.html) 

              
One of the myths about F# and functional programming is that it is only good for complex mathematics.
This could not be further from truth. A web server is essentially a function from a request to a response
and so functional programming is a perfect fit for it.

This workshop covers all you need to get started with building web applications in F# using the
Suave server. By the end of the workshop, you'll write a real-world web application that works with data,
handles concurrency and can be easily deployed to Azure or Heroku.

## Domain driven design with F# ##

This course teaches you how to use types as part of a domain driven process, emphasizing
real world examples over jargon and maths. In this course, you'll learn how to use F# types
to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self-documenting way.

The type system is your friend, not an annoyance. You'll learn how to use
types to your benefit - and types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally
cannot create incorrect code.

## [Accessing Data with Type Providers](workshops/type-providers.html)

Modern applications need to access data from a variety of external data sources, including
XML, SQL, and JSON-based services. In this course, we look at F# type providers. With type
providers, you can easily explore and access a wide range of data sources directly from your code editor.
We start by learning about type providers using the F# interactive and then we demonstrate how you can
integrate data access code written in F# as part of a larger C# ASP.NET project.

## [F# in Finance](workshops/finance.html)

Functional-first programming in F# is an effective tool for solving complex problems that often arise in financial computing. The strong typing of F# provides important correctness guarantees and means that numeric code written in F# runs efficiently.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of case-studies show that F# significantly reduces time-to-market, especially in the financial domain.
The course is practically focused. Throughout the course, we look at examples of time-series analysis, modelling and pricing of stock options and more.
