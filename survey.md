## Welcome to the annual F# surveys!


As the F# community continues to grow, we at fsharpWorks think that it is helpful to all of us to get hard data on how we use F#, what is going well, and what needs more work. We hope that the answers to these questions will provide actionable data that can used by the community to improve F#.
Plus, it's a bit of fun!  Who doesn't love looking at surveys?

These are NOT "official" surveys sponsored by the F# Software Foundation or Microsoft. They are sponsored by us at fsharpWorks, as a fun way to share information about the F# community.

### <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/fsharp-community-survey-2016">F# in Numbers: A Look at the Annual F# Survey Results</a>

In April, for the second time, fsharpWorks organized the F# community survey. Over 600 developers completed the survey in 2016 (which is 15% more than in 2015). The survey provides an insight into the brains of the F# community. In this article, I'll summarize some of the results.

What are the reasons why developers choose F# for their projects in 2016? How are they using F# and what are the application domains where F# excels? What are the new trends since the previous year? And what are the biggest challenges for the future?

This is the F# snippet used to analyze results of the fsharpWorks annual F# community survey to figure out what are the most popular F# tools and libraries. The snippet does some minimal data cleanup, but more work is needed to get precise results!
